[Build Details](https://travis-ci.org/grails-plugins/grails-quartz/)
## Branches

The current master branch is for 2.x versions of the plugin compatible with Grails 3. There is a 1.x branch for on-going maintenance of 1.x versions of the plugin compatible with Grails 2. Please submit any pull requests to the appropriate branch. Changes to the 1.x branch will be merged into the master branch if appropriate.

## Using
### Quick start
To start using Quartz plugin just simply add ```compile 'org.grails.plugins:quartz:2.0.9'``` in your ```build.gradle```.

### Scheduling Jobs
To create a new job run the `grails create-job` command and enter the name of the job. Grails will create a new job and place it in the `grails-app/jobs` directory:

    package com.mycompany.myapp

    class MyJob {

        static triggers = {
            simple repeatInterval: 1000
        }

        void execute() {
            print "Job run!"
        }
    }

The above example will call the 'execute' method every second.

### Scheduling configuration syntax
Currently plugin supports three types of [triggers](http://quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.x/tutorials/tutorial-lesson-02):
* **simple trigger** — executes once per defined interval (ex. "every 10 seconds");
* **cron trigger** — executes job with cron expression (ex. "at 8:00 am every Monday through Friday");
* **custom trigger** — your implementation of [Trigger](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/api/2.2.0/org/quartz/Trigger.html) interface.

Multiple triggers per job are allowed.

    class MyJob {

        static triggers = {
            simple name: 'simpleTrigger', startDelay: 10000, repeatInterval: 30000, repeatCount: 10
            cron name:   'cronTrigger',   startDelay: 10000, cronExpression: '0/6 * 15 * * ?'
            custom name: 'customTrigger', triggerClass: MyTriggerClass, myParam: myValue, myAnotherParam: myAnotherValue
        }

        void execute() {
            println "Job run!"
        }
    }

With this configuration job will be executed 11 times with 30 seconds interval with first run in 10 seconds after
scheduler startup (simple trigger), also it'll be executed each 6 second during 15th hour
(15:00:00, 15:00:06, 15:00:12, ... — this configured by cron trigger) and also it'll be executed each time your custom
trigger will fire.

Three kinds of triggers are supported with the following parameters. The name field must be unique:
* `simple`:
  * `name` — the name that identifies the trigger;
  * `startDelay` — delay (in milliseconds) between scheduler startup and first job's execution;
  * `repeatInterval` — timeout (in milliseconds) between consecutive job's executions;
  * `repeatCount` — trigger will fire job execution `(1 + repeatCount)` times and stop after that (specify `0`  here to have one-shot job or `-1` to repeat job executions indefinitely);
* `cron`:
  * `name` — the name that identifies the trigger;
  * `startDelay` — delay (in milliseconds) between scheduler startup and first job's execution;
  * `cronExpression` — [cron expression](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/api/2.2.0/org/quartz/CronExpression.html)
* `custom`:
  * `triggerClass`  — your class which implements [CalendarIntervalTriggerImpl](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/api/2.2.0/org/quartz/impl/triggers/CalendarIntervalTriggerImpl.html) impl;
  * any params needed by your trigger.

### Configuration plugin syntax

You can add the following properties to control persisteance or not persistence:
* quartz.pluginEnabled - defaults to true, can disable plugin for test cases etc
* quartz.jdbcStore - true to enable database store, false to use RamStore (default true)
* quartz.autoStartup - delays jobs until after bootstrap startup phase (default false)
* quartz.jdbcStoreDataSource - jdbc data source alternate name
* quartz.waitForJobsToCompleteOnShutdown - wait for jobs to complete on shutdown (default true)
* quartz.exposeSchedulerInRepository - expose Schedule in repository
* quartz.scheduler.instanceName - name of the scheduler to avoid conflicts between apps
* quartz.purgeQuartzTablesOnStartup - when jdbcStore set to 'true' and this is true, clears out all quartz tables on startup
